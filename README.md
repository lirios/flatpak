# Liri apps for Flatpak

This repository performs nightly builds of Liri apps Flatpaks.

Some apps like Files and Terminal are built even though they don't support Flatpak yet
given that they don't have access to the host file system.

Nightly builds result in the `master` OSTree branch.

Stable builds of Liri apps that completely support Flatpak, are on [Flathub](https://flathub.org).
